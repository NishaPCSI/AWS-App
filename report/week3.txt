Week 3

The whole basically boils down to more stuff for frontend & slightly polishing it

- now its finally possible add task from the site itself 
(previously had to manually add tasks to the database using queries)

When clicking on "Today's Tasks", a pop up enters in with cool animations for making a new task

This pop up has: Title, Deadline, Description, Task Priority, Phase/Status & Project Link
Task Priority decides the priority of the task, if the task is on critical, 
notification of them will be recieved every 6hrs 
& for high, medium & low, it will be 12hrs, 24hrs & 48hrs (might change in the future)
Project Link will be implemented later.

When clicked "done", if the deadline is todays, the task appears in the "Today's Task"
Otherwise, the task for now can viewed in the "Calendar"

- For now, Calendar shows all the task available in the month, sorting them deadline wise.
In the next week, we plan to implement them to show month & allow to change the month.

- Empty pages were added to all the categories present in navbar.

Other misc stuff include
- Making the logo unselectable
- throwing error, if the email already exists
- redirect to homepage, if the user had already logged in previously
- fix security perms for cookies
- make a pop up for notes (unimplemented)
- padding & margin changes to navbar
